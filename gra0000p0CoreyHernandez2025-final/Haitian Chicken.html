    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Clean the chicken thoroughly. See the directions in the post.
        Season the chicken with the Haitian Epis and salt. Marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes. Best overnight.
        In a heavy bottom pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add oil and sear the meat on both sides until lightly golden brown; do not discard the marinating sauce that's left behind in the bowl as we will use it.
        Sear the meat in batches to make it easy to brown.
        While the meat is browning (or once you have browned all the meat), add the water to the marinating bowl. Stir to mix the liquid and the seasoning together. Set aside.
        Remove meat from heat and place on a plate. </li>
      <li>In the same pan, sautee the dice onions and garlic until fragrant (about 45 seconds), then add the tomato paste and a few pieces of the sliced bell peppers. Stir to combine.
        Next, deglaze with about ¼ of the seasoned liquid. Then add the chicken and the juice from the plate.
        Quickly spoon a few of the onion mixture pieces onto the chicken. This will give it a reddish color. </li>
      <li>Add the remaining ingredients: lemon juice, Goya Adobo Seasoning and herbs, and season with salt and pepper to taste, and bell peppers.</li>
      <li>Stir lightly. Cover. Allow to simmer for 15-20 minutes over medium heat. </li>
      <li>Reduce the heat to low. Uncover the sauce and add sliced onions.
        Add more seasoning if needed. 
        Stir lightly, cover, and simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes on low heat. 
        Serve warm with rice or your preferred side and enjoy!</li>
